Meow to the stars
Meow, the Star Cat greets you, wanderer in the Universe. Today I'm admiring the dawn... Oh, the face of the Sun emerges from its burrow like a mouse, spreading its colors. Hmm, the sunbeam resembles a sacred symbol-my eyes are like projectors. I'm chasing the sunbeam through the treehouse, trying to capture it with my soft paw. I think I've cornered it in a dark closet, where it shines and winks at me. I wanted to say...Yes, I wanted to. Murrr... a sausage with hot coffee. Oh yes, the sun is a hologram and the sky is like a texture, with glitter sprinkled on my fur. I'm happy.The macrocosm in the microcosm. So I swallowed the universe and the universe swallowed me? Oh, look, my tail, I'll catch you!

The star cat squints at the sun and says one sun and two suns.Two suns.Look...He wipes his eyes and now there are three suns.Meow.Cat philosophy.Meow, not philosophy, but photon arithmetic, says the cat!

I'm flying to distant stars, either inside or outside. Either inside or outside. Or maybe both at the same time. Mewwwww
